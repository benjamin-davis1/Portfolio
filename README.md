# Portfolio

1. Arduino LCD Control is C++ code written to control an LCD screen from scratch from an Arduino Uno.
2. Arduino Maze Robot is C++ code that controls a robot through a maze, detecting walls and navigating itself to two goals before returning home.
3. Python Chess is a personal interest project with the aim to replicate a functional chess game without references (without looking at the internet etc.).
4. Robot Arm Control is a Matlab project where a robot arm is programmed to build a brick wall. This project makes use of Peter Corke's robotic toolbox.
5. Vector Risk Snippets are just a few examples of C# code written for work on an SPI, Windows background service and accompanying UI. Due to confidentiality issues, only a small amount of that code can be shown.
